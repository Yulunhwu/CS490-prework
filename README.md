## Notes

I was trying to implement an animated launch screen with animation while action occurs, However, I don't know a way to stop the animation, which makes it keep occuring. Therefore, I decide not to use it.
P.S. I used my friend's Macbook to code this program, therefore, the name on the uploader is not my name.
